<h1> 1 </h1> 


      <img id = "img" src="1.jpg" style="width:500px;height:350px;">
      
      <p>As I put my initial ideas together, I realized that this app would serve for a bigger purpose than what I intended. I wanted people to be sure they knew their rights and highlighted this part of the storyboard. I visualized the scenarios like someone biking, running, driving as they were stopped by police officers. The "alert" message was an inspiration from another storyboard and felt it was appropriate to use. I decided to add a recording mechanism that would help record what was going on at the scene. All together, I had a lot on my mind and I was finally able to put my ideas together. 
    
    
        <h1>2</h1>
  
<img id = "img" src="2.jpg" style="width:500px;height:350px;">
    
<p>
   As I recieved feedback from my first storyboard, I had to focus on the things that were most important. Crowd sourcing along with "Knowing your rights" were the main things I wanted to focus on. The crowd sourcing would make an impact when the user uses the map-based app to locate themselves and share their experiences. If the user is in danger, there will not be a recording button but rather a few buttoms that best describes their situation.
