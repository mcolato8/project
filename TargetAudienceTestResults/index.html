    <p> The user was content with the overall goal of the app. Tey believed it was very direct and they understood what was expected of them. They suggested adding activists events are your location that can help the community express themselves. They believed including self-identifying categories would definitely help with data. I will be applying the categories in the message box along with a prototype of locations people can meet at. </p>
    
    
    <h1> 2nd person </h1> 
<img src="images/audience2.png" height="300" width="400" alt="keys" id="img" />  
    
    <p>In the application, there are three options from where to choose from on the bottom of the screen. "Message", "Know Your Rights" and "Information" had an icon but the person suggested removing information and putting it in the menu icon. They tested both my most recent prototype along with my interactive prototype 3 which they also liked. They suggested a balance between the both in terms of design. To add to the data, the user suggested adding photo/video for more accuracy. I can try adding photo/video library but as for now, I will be trying to enhance the design of the app itself.  </p>

    <h1> 3rd person </h1> 
    <img src="images/audience3.png" height="300" width="400" alt="keys" id="img" />  
    
 <p>Live newsfeed was one of the main suggestions the third user expressed. A big reference would be twitter and how they communicate instantly. Also, they suggested being able to add footage to the app and adding a resources page along with some sord of "trend" happening around the area. I really do like the geolocation idea along with the newsfeed. </p>
